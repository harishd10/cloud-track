Track Cloud Systems
===================

A visual exploration framework to track and query cloud systems.

Reference:
Harish Doraiswamy, Vijay Natarajan, and Ravi S. Nanjundiah, "An Exploration framework to identify and track movement of cloud systems", IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (IEEE SciVis â€™13), 19 (12), 2013, 2896--2905.


The code is an Eclipse peoject. To run the framework, you also need python with opencv and numpy support. The data sets supported are:

[1] CPC-merged IR brightness temperature data. http://mirador.gsfc.nasa.gov/collections/MERG__001.shtml
[2] Nasa trmm repository. http://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov/.

To run the framework, you need to execute the following sub-programs in the given order:

(1) Java program: hope.it.works.data.IRDataLittleEndian (for data from [1]) or TrmmNCDataLittleEndian (for data from [2]). Note that you need to specify (in the code) the region of interest, and you can also optionally specify if you want to sub-sample the data. This preprocesses the data creates files that are read by the framework.

(2) Python program: createFlow.py (or createFlowTrmm.py) - This creates a flow field using the preprocessed data. Note again that you need to specify the resolution, extent, and other options (data location etc.) in the code.

(3) Java program: vgl.iisc.volray.MapViewer - This reads a property file (sample available in input/ directory). 

Options for the viewer (3) can be specified by pressing "c" and entering a command. I'll soon make a list of commands supported.
For now, you can check the executeComment() function in OffRendererTime.java
